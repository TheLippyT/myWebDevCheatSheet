    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello everyone. I have created this page to display some 
        sort of guide for the field of web development. this is 
        created with the help of a guide made by Traversy Media.
        He can be found on youtube<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pThnRneDjw" target="_blank">
        (Here is a link to the video).</a>I have made this page
        to both help me create something and at the same time
        help me practice my web development skills. So without 
        further adieu let us continue on with the guide. Enjoy!
      </p>
      <p>P.S. I will try my best to keep this updated in the 
        future. Maybe there will be even more amazing technologies.
        Also someone made a compiled list of the topics that are 
        shown in the video. you can find the link in the video 
        description or you can follow this <a href="https://github.com/andrews1022/web-development-2020-course-list" 
        target="_blank">link</a>. The links he supplied all
        redirect you to Udemy. The liks that i will add(if 
        possible) will redirect you to some free resources.
        However they may or may not be updated.
